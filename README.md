# Embla Carousel Setup (Next.js 15)

This project demonstrates how to implement **Embla Carousel**, a lightweight and extensible slider library, in a modern **Next.js 15** app. Through progressive examples, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate Embla, organize your components, and add useful features like arrow controls and dot navigation.

## What This Project Covers

- Installing and initializing Embla Carousel in a Next.js project
- Creating a basic slider with static content
- Separating slide content into reusable components
- Adding arrow navigation with `emblaApi.scrollPrev()` and `scrollNext()`
- Adding dot indicators with dynamic selection tracking

Each example builds on the last, providing a scalable pattern you can apply in real-world use cases such as image galleries, featured products, or portfolio sliders.
